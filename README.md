# 16h5-pdfs

These are pre-generated PDFs of the 16h5 AprilTag family, made to be approximately 6 inches when printed on letter paper.
They were generated by transplanting [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) commands from [rgov's 36h11 library](https://github.com/rgov/apriltag-pdfs) for the 16h5 tags, so credit where it's due.
